/** @see
  *   https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/advanced_topics/consumer_version_selectors/ and
  *   https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/issues/307. Gets converted into a
  *   au.com.dius.pact.core.pactbroker.ConsumerVersionSelector under the hood.
  *
  * @param tag
  *   the tag name(s) of the consumer versions to get the pacts for.
  * @param latest
  *   the name of the tag to fallback to if the specified tag does not exist. This is useful when the consumer and
  *   provider use matching branch names to coordinate the development of new features.
  * @param fallbackTag
  *   default true. If the latest flag is omitted, all the pacts with the specified tag will be returned. (This might
  *   seem a bit weird, but it's done this way to match the syntax used for the matrix query params. See
  *   https://docs.pact.io/selectors)
  * @param consumer
  *   allows a selector to only be applied to a certain consumer. This is used for example when there is an API that has
  *   multiple consumers, one of which is a deployed service, and one of which is a mobile consumer. The deployed
  *   service only needs the latest production pact verified, where as the mobile consumer may want all the production
  *   pacts verified.
  * @param additionalSelectors
  *   see
  *   https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/blob/master/lib/pact_broker/doc/views/provider-pacts-for-verification.markdown
  *   for a list of available selectors that can be set. This list is subject to change and so we leave it to the user
  *   add any other selectors they require here rather than having them as strongly-typed fields.
